Grok response to run-time challenges

Replace Subprocess with Direct Import: Import travel_time.py as a module and call its function directly instead of using subprocess. This cuts process spawn time.

Cache the Gauge: Wrap CompassRoseGauge creation and rendering in @st.cache_data with a TTL (e.g., 3600) to avoid redrawing unless data changes.

Lower Gauge DPI: Drop dpi=200 to 100 or 150—still sharp enough for 2000px display but faster to render.

Async API Calls: Use asyncio or concurrent.futures to parallelize get_current_conditions, get_wave_height, and barometric calls on first load.

Cache Plots: Cache the Matplotlib figures for barometric and tide plots, not just their data, to skip styling overhead.


Recap of Conversation (April 10, 2025)
Context: You’re working on a Streamlit dashboard (dashboard.py) for Groton Long Point, displaying weather, tides, barometric pressure, and travel data. We’ve been tweaking fonts and optimizing performance, especially focusing on travel_time.py, which was slowing things down locally.
Font Exploration:
Started with adding "Architects Daughter" to your CompassRoseGauge class for a hand-drawn beach house vibe. Fixed the font path to C:/Users/teren/Tides/ArchitectsDaughter-Regular.ttf.

Explored rustic, weathered fonts on Google Fonts for a beach house look: Special Elite, IM Fell English, Amatic SC, Permanent Marker, Rock Salt, Rye. You’re leaning toward these but paused to rest.

Dashboard Slowdown:
Noticed the dashboard lagging locally, suspecting travel time callouts and other bloat.

Analyzed dashboard.py:
Subprocess Overhead: get_travel_data runs travel_time.py via subprocess.run (100-500ms extra).

API Calls: Weather, wave, and barometric data (TTL=3600) take 3-6s on initial load.

Gauge Rendering: CompassRoseGauge (50x18.75, dpi=200) takes 1-3s per redraw, uncached.

Suggested: Import travel_time.py directly, cache the gauge, lower DPI, async APIs.

Optimizing travel_time.py:
Original: Calculated drive times (both directions), all today’s trains, tomorrow’s trains—3-10s runtime.

Updated Goal: Drive time from GLP to Chatham + next Mystic-to-Boston train.

Streamlined:
Cut Chatham-to-GLP and tomorrow’s trains.

One Waze call (1-3s), optimized Amtrak API to stop at first train (1-2s), static fallback.

New runtime: 2-5s.

Full updated code provided, returns two strings (e.g., "2 hours and 55 minutes", "1:47 PM").

Running Standalone:
Instructions: cd C:\Users\teren\Tides, then python -c "import time; t0 = time.time(); exec(open('travel_time.py').read()); print(f'Runtime: {time.time() - t0:.2f} seconds')".

Hit a Windows glitch (blank CMD from search), suggested reboot.

Current State:
You’ve got the updated travel_time.py ready to test standalone.

Dashboard integration: Replace subprocess with from travel_time import get_drive_time, get_next_train.

Paused for rest and a reboot due to the CMD issue.

Next Steps (When You’re Back)
Test travel_time.py standalone and check runtime.

Update dashboard.py with the direct import if it’s snappy enough.

Decide on fonts or further optimize the gauge if needed.

Feel free to toss this recap back at me when you’re refreshed, and we’ll roll from there! Rest well!
